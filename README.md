# Crown Trophy Automation Project - Candlefish AI

Welcome to the Crown Trophy automation project! This repository contains all documentation, code, and resources for automating Crown Trophy's engraving and order management processes.

## Project Vision

Transform Crown Trophy's manual processes into an AI-powered automation system that:
- Reduces engraving data entry from 45+ minutes to under 1 minute
- Optimizes vendor selection and freight costs
- Streamlines order management across multiple locations
- Potentially saves $4.29M annually across 150 Crown Trophy franchises
