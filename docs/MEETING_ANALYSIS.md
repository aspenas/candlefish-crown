# Crown Trophy - Marshall Meeting Analysis

## Meeting Overview
**Date**: July 2025
**Attendees**: Patrick Smith, Marshall (Crown Trophy Littleton)
**Duration**: ~90 minutes
**Location**: Crown Trophy Littleton store

## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Pain Point: Manual Engraving Data Entry
The Golden Marlins example perfectly illustrates the problem:
- **276 items** requiring engraving
- **45+ minutes** of manual data entry
- **$276 revenue** (only $1 per item)
- **Process**: Copy each name from Excel → Paste into Corel Draw → Format → Repeat 276 times

**Business Impact**: At $15/hour labor, this job barely breaks even. The manual process is unsustainable.

## Detailed Pain Points Analysis

### 1. Engraving Workflow Inefficiencies

#### Current Process:
1. Customer sends Excel/Word/PDF with names
2. Employee opens file
3. Manually copies each entry (name, award type, etc.)
4. Pastes into Corel Draw
5. Formats text (font, size, alignment)
6. Arranges on material layout
7. Exports to laser software

#### Specific Challenges:
- **Variable data complexity**: Names + awards + dates + custom text
- **Format inconsistencies**: "Smith, Patrick" vs "Patrick Smith"
- **Material optimization**: Fitting maximum items on 12"x24" sheets
- **Font requirements**: Athletic vs academic styles
- **Error prone**: Manual typos, missed entries

### 2. Order Management Chaos

#### Current System: Google Sheets
- **Color coding**: 
  - White = Not ordered
  - Yellow = Ordered but not arrived ("YOLO")
  - Blue = Arrived and checked in
  - Strikethrough Bold = Shared between locations
- **10 users** with write access
- **No version control** or audit trail
- **Manual updates** for every status change

#### Problems:
- Anyone can accidentally delete/modify data
- No real-time sync between locations
- No integration with inventory
- Manual checking for order status

### 3. Inventory Management Nightmare

Marshall's quote: **"Inventory is a freaking nightmare"**

#### Current Reality:
- **2,000+ SKUs** across locations
- **Manual counting** and spreadsheet entry
- **No depletion tracking** from orders
- **"Borrowing" between stores** tracked informally
- **No predictive ordering**

#### Industry-Wide Problem:
"None of the 150 Crown Trophy locations have figured out inventory"

### 4. Vendor Selection Complexity

#### The Challenge:
Marshall is the **only person** who manages ordering because:
- 6+ vendors with different catalogs
- Freight minimums vary wildly ($200-$1,000)
- Similar products across vendors at different prices
- Promotions change every few years
- Need to combine orders to hit freight minimums

#### Current Process:
1. Check what needs ordering across all locations
2. Mental math to optimize vendor selection
3. Combine orders to hit freight minimums
4. Place orders manually
5. Track arrivals on spreadsheet

### 5. Technology Limitations

#### Existing Tools:
- **Crown Workflow**: Basic order management, syncs with QuickBooks
- **Corel Draw**: Design software (75% of franchises use this)
- **QuickBooks Desktop**: Accounting (not Online)
- **Google Sheets**: Order tracking
- **No shopping cart**: Licensing restriction from franchisor

#### Integration Issues:
- No data flow between systems
- Manual re-entry at each step
- QuickBooks Desktop harder to integrate than Online
- Each tool operates in isolation

## Business Metrics & Opportunities

### Volume Insights:
- **Email orders**: 75% of business
- **Walk-ins**: 25% of business
- **Typical engraving job**: 50-300 items
- **Frequency**: Multiple jobs per week

### Time Savings Potential:
- Current: 45 minutes for 276 items
- Target: < 1 minute
- **Time saved**: 44 minutes per job
- **Weekly impact**: 36+ hours saved (assuming 50 jobs)

### Financial Impact:
- **Labor savings**: $540/week ($28,080/year) per location
- **Freight optimization**: 15% reduction (~$7,500/year)
- **Inventory optimization**: 20% carrying cost reduction
- **Error reduction**: Fewer remakes and rush orders
