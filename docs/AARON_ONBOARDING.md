# Aaron Westphal - Crown Trophy Project Onboarding

Welcome to the Crown Trophy automation project, Aaron! This document provides everything you need to get up to speed and start contributing effectively.

## Project Overview

### The Vision
We're building an AI-powered automation system for Crown Trophy that will revolutionize how they handle engraving orders, inventory, and vendor management. This isn't just another CRUD app - it's a sophisticated document intelligence system that will save franchises hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.

### Partnership Approach
As our development partner, we're offering flexible collaboration options:
1. Lead the initial development architecture (recommended for maximum autonomy)
2. Collaborate on design and enhance our initial scope

You have **full access** to the project and all API keys - we value your architectural insights and technical leadership.

## Critical Context

### Company Status
- **Candlefish AI LLC** was just approved by Morgan Stanley last week
- Tyler is currently migrating all projects, credentials, and services
- There will be some lag on infrastructure items initially
- A business operations specialist will join soon to handle back-office tasks

### Team Collaboration
- **Slack Channel**: Tyler will create and invite you (ACTION ITEM)
- **AWS Access**: Tyler will set up your IAM account with appropriate permissions (ACTION ITEM)
- **GitHub**: You have access to this repository
- **Communication**: Direct access to Patrick, Tyler, and Marshall

## The Business Problem

### Current Pain Points at Crown Trophy

1. **Manual Engraving Data Entry (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
   - Currently takes **45+ minutes** for jobs like Golden Marlins (276 items)
   - Revenue: Only $1 per engraved item ($276 for 45 minutes work)
   - Process: Manual copy/paste from Excel to Corel Draw
   - **Our Goal**: Reduce to under 1 minute with AI

2. **Order Management Chaos**
   - Using Google Sheets with color coding (white/yellow/blue)
   - 10 users with write access, no version control
   - No integration between orders and inventory
   - **Our Goal**: Unified system with real-time updates

3. **Inventory Nightmare**
   - 2,000+ SKUs across 3 locations
   - Manual counting and spreadsheet entry
   - No automated reordering or tracking
   - **Our Goal**: Automated tracking with predictive reordering

4. **Vendor Complexity**
   - 6+ vendors with different freight minimums ($200-$1000)
   - Marshall manually optimizes to hit freight minimums
   - Promotions change every few years
   - **Our Goal**: AI-powered vendor selection

## Key Decisions for Aaron

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Architecture**: Monolith vs microservices for initial MVP?
2. **Desktop Framework**: Electron vs Tauri for Windows app?
3. **AI Integration**: Direct API vs LangChain abstraction?
4. **Database**: Single vs separate databases per location?

### Development Approach Options
We could approach this in several ways:
- A) You lead the initial architecture and we collaborate on refinements
- B) We create an initial implementation for you to review and enhance
- C) We collaborate on architecture design then divide feature development

## Questions for Joint Marshall Sessions

When we meet with Marshall together, key areas to explore:
1. Exact Corel Draw version and export formats
2. Laser engraver software compatibility
3. Peak season timing and volume
4. Most complex engraving job examples
5. QuickBooks Desktop integration specifics

## Next Steps

### Week 1 Tasks
1. [ ] Set up development environment
2. [ ] Review all project documentation
3. [ ] Connect with Tyler for AWS access
4. [ ] Initial architecture decisions
5. [ ] Start document intelligence prototype

### Action Items for Team
- **Tyler**: Create Slack channel, set up Aaron's AWS IAM
- **Patrick**: Schedule architecture review meeting
- **Aaron**: Review docs, set up environment, initial questions

## Final Thoughts

This project has massive potential - both for Crown Trophy and as a product we can sell to the entire industry. Your expertise will be crucial in making this vision a reality.

We believe in giving you autonomy to make technical decisions while staying aligned with business goals. Don't hesitate to challenge assumptions or propose better approaches.

Welcome to the team! Let's build something amazing together.
